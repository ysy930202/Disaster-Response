## 1. Project Overview

In this project, I apply data engineer to analyze disaster data from Figure Eight to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages.

In the Project Workspace, the data set containing real messages that were sent during disaster events will be used. I created a machine learning pipeline to categorize these events so that appropriate disaster relief agency can be reached out for help.

My project will include a web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories. The web app will also display visualizations of the data.

## 2. Project Components

There are three components of this project:

<a id='etl_pipeline'></a>

### 2.1. ETL Pipeline

File _data/process_data.py_ contains data cleaning pipeline that:

- Loads the `messages` and `categories` dataset
- Merges the two datasets
- Cleans the data
- Stores it in a **SQLite database**

<a id='ml_pipeline'></a>

### 2.2. ML Pipeline

File _models/train_classifier.py_ contains machine learning pipeline that:

- Loads data from the **SQLite database**
- Splits the data into training and testing sets
- Builds a text processing and machine learning pipeline
- Trains and tunes a model using GridSearchCV
- Outputs result on the test set
- Exports the final model as a pickle file

## 3. Running

There are three steps to get up and runnning with the web app if you want to start from ETL process.

<a id='cleaning'></a>

### 3.1. Data Cleaning

**Go to the project directory** and the run the following command:

```bat
python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db
```

The first two arguments are input data and the third argument is the SQLite Database in which we want to save the cleaned data. The ETL pipeline is in _process_data.py_.

_DisasterResponse.db_ already exists in _data_ folder but the above command will still run and replace the file with same information.

### 3.2. Training Classifier

After the data cleaning process, run this command **from the project directory**:

```bat
python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl
```

This will use cleaned data to train the model, improve the model with grid search and saved the model to a pickle file (_classifer.pkl_).

_classifier.pkl_ already exists but the above command will still run and replace the file will same information.

### 3.3. Starting the web app

Now that we have cleaned the data and trained our model. Now it's time to see the prediction in a user friendly way.

**Go the app directory** and run the following command:

<a id='com'></a>

```bat
python run.py
```
